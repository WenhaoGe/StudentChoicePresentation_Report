## The history of the device/technique:

Founded in 2005 by a group of engineers and physicians

## Where is it used?

It is used in hospitals and medical device industries.

## What are best suited applications?

ImmersiveTouch provides hospitals with a vast expansion of patient engagement tools to educate & consult patients on their personal treatment options. Our Surgical VR technology helps the patient fully experience how a surgeon would treat his or her case in an immersive 3D environment, freeing up valuable time for the surgeon.

VR allows the patient to visualize his or her anatomy with 3D reconstructions of CT/MRI scans.
ImmersiveTouch technology engages and educates patients, allowing them to see and understand different treatment options
Empowering the patient with knowledge ultimately leads to better patient outcomes

Pre-surgical planning and mission rehearsal,
Patient education and engagement

## Why is it a good use of VR?

Engagement and education empowers patients and can increase patient satisfaction. ImmersiveTouch VR allows doctors to walk patients through the proposed intervention and provides an opportunity to actively consult with them.
Through VR doctors can:
Educate patients and reduce anxiety

Empower patients to ask questions and increase understanding

Encourage patients to participate in final decision making

Improve compliance with post surgical care

Virtual reality is transforming professional training in healthcare. Increase retention and reduce radiation exposure with medical VR training programs that are realistic, immersive and repeatable. Ensure all levels of staff accurately execute medical procedures and handle complications appropriately before touching real patients. ImmersiveTouch MissionRehearsal® VR is changing the way organizations train people. Gain an edge today with these proven advantages:
Drastically improves retention of topics

Boosts productivity

Increases patient safety

Brings an enhanced level of realism to training scenarios

Reduces radiation exposure

Improves training satisfaction scores

ImmersiveTouch provides the critical ability to reduce risk, surgical error and procedure time while improving patient outcomes, safety and satisfaction.

## Could this lead to varying degrees of simulator sickness? 

It will lead to some degrees of headache, eyestrain, and fatigue. My rating on the scale is 3.

## The potential applications?

there are several urologic training simulators using the VR technique such as the digital rectal examination to detect prostate cancer, transurethral resection of the prostate, flexible ureteroscopy, and laparoscopic and robotic surgery. A novel application of VR/AR in neurourology is necessary after reviewing and understanding the VR/AR technology

## What are the similar applications?

Medical Realities is working on a simulating surgery with their ‘Virtual Surgeon;
Deepstream VR is an organization whose emphasis is on pain relief;
Virtually Better is attempting to utilize VR in various therapies and treatments;
Firsthand Technology is an organization which represents the synergy which can occur between Healthcare and Gaming when using VR technology

## Conclusion

It is necessary to highlight that VR's development is rapid. Many Silicon Valley companies invest enough money in the VR. And VR is used widely in many industries, such as gaming industry, film industry and journalism. I encourage people who have never used VR before to find a headset and immerse themselves in the powerful works of visual reality.
